        <h1>Let me Introduce Myself üåû</h1>
        <img src="images/Jess-pp.jpg" class="img-circle" width="100px" alt="Jess PP">
        <p>Hey friend ! My name is Jess and I'm a 22 years old, soon to be graduated business student. Dynamic and always beaming, my personality is characterized by a contagious enthusiasm that transcends everyday challenges. Driven by my passion for dance, I find an inexhaustible source of energy and creativity on the dance floor. Born of Polish parents, I am enriched daily by the culture of my two roots, particularly through my passion for cooking, where I venture to marry traditional Polish flavors with inspirations from all over the world. My thirst for discovery has also led me to explore many horizons, as I firmly believe that travel broadens our horizons and enriches our understanding of the world. My dynamism, my smile, and my love for cultural diversity are fundamental pillars that guide my personal and professional path.

        <h2>Poland üáµüá±</h2>
        <p>My Polish origins are an inseparable part of my identity, a source of pride that has profoundly shaped my personality. Coming from a family that originated entirely in <strong><em>Poland</em></strong>, I firmly believe that I am a true Pole. My fluency in the Polish language is just the beginning, as every year I immerse myself in the richness of our culture by returning to the country. It's a must, an opportunity to connect with my roots and strengthen my ties with the land of my ancestors. This regular experience has not only deepened my understanding of Polish culture, it has also strengthened my pride in sharing it. I love talking about our wonderful traditions, sharing our delicious cuisine and perpetuating Poland's unique cultural heritage. These roots have undoubtedly influenced my personality, instilling in me an open-mindedness, a deep appreciation of diversity, and a particular attachment to family and traditional values.

        <h2>Traveling ‚úàÔ∏è</h2>
        <p>My love of <strong><em>travel</em></strong> is like a compass that guides my life. I've already travelled to over 20 countries on 2 different continents, savouring every encounter, every dish, every landscape as a unique adventure. But the excitement doesn't stop there - I can't wait to discover every corner of the planet that my feet haven't yet trodden. Speaking of languages, I'm juggling Polish (obviously), French, English, Italian and Spanish. It's my way of fully immersing myself in each culture, understanding people and sharing authentic moments. The suitcases are always ready, because for me, the world is a constant invitation to explore.

        <h2>Dance üíÉ</h2>
        <p> <strong><em>Dance</em></strong> has always been the common thread running through my life. Since the age of 4, I've been expressing myself through this art form that transcends words. My path has led me to explore various dance clubs, allowing me to explore a wide range of styles, from afro to dancehall, modern jazz and many more. More than just a passion, dance has become an integral part of my personality, providing me with exceptional opportunities, including a performance at Paris Bercy scheduled for December. Much more than just a hobby, dance acts as an outlet, providing me with relaxation, expression and peace of mind, especially in times of upset. Each movement, each choreography becomes an extension of myself, a way of communicating beyond words and finding balance in bodily expression.

        <h2>Cooking üë®‚Äçüç≥</h2>
        <p> <strong><em>Cooking</em></strong> is another of my deepest passions. My father, a chef in a restaurant near Paris, has been the inspirational guide to my culinary exploration since my early childhood. The influence of his profession gave me an early introduction to the art of gastronomy. Despite my busy schedule, I'm constantly striving to broaden my culinary skills by concocting new dishes, an adventure I enthusiastically share with my friends. For me, preparing meals becomes much more than a simple culinary activity; it's a way of expressing my creativity and sharing moments of conviviality around homemade delights. Each dish is a canvas where I blend flavors and textures to create a unique gastronomic experience, perpetuating the family culinary tradition.
